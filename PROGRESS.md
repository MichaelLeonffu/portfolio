## Next.js and Vercel Tutorial

11:00

Firstly need to learn what the bare minimum is for making a Next.js project.

- I just skimmed it because this isn't the first time for me: [Next.js Docs](https://nextjs.org/learn/foundations)
- There are so many choices: but I'll stick with just getting a basic site online first.
- [Next.js Getting started](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started):
- `npx create-next-app@latest --typescript`
- Upload to github at [github.com/MichaelLeonffu/portfolio](https://github.com/MichaelLeonffu/portfolio)
