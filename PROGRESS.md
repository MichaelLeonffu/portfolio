A list of steps I took and how long each one took me. This is only a record, not an in-depth tutorial.

## Next.js and Vercel Tutorial
**1 hour**

Firstly need to learn what the bare minimum is for making a Next.js project.

- I just skimmed it because this isn't the first time for me: [Next.js Docs](https://nextjs.org/learn/foundations)
- There are so many choices: but I'll stick with just getting a basic site online first.
- [Next.js Getting started](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started):
- `npx create-next-app@latest --typescript`
- Upload to github at [github.com/MichaelLeonffu/portfolio](https://github.com/MichaelLeonffu/portfolio)
- Connect it with [Vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
- Then, if you have a domain, set it using: [Vercel Domain Settings](https://vercel.com/michaelleonffu/portfolio/settings/domains)
- Make some changes to [index.tsx](./pages/index.tsx) to show Michael Leonffu
- Temporarily changed [favicon.ico](./public/favicon.ico)
